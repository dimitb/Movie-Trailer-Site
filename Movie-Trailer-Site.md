Movie-Trailer-Site
==================
This Movie Trailer Website is the first project in the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree program that displays a simple website coded and run through python. The site lists 6 of my all time favorite movies featuring each movie's poster as well as its respective synopsis, release date, and rating along with a link to its Rotten Tomatoes page with more info.

----------

Getting Started
-------------
Movie-Trailer-Site was written using Python 2.7. To ensure the site displays, and the code runs, properly, make sure you have Python 2.7 or later installed on your system. (Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

With Python 2.7 or later installed, download the three (3) python files within the Movie-Trailer-Site repository (*entertainment_center.py*, *fresh_tomatoes.py*, and *media.py*). After downloading, open the files in your local Python IDE and run the *entertainment_center.py* file.

As the *entertainment_center.py* file runs it will open up a new tab or window in your default web browser displaying the site.

More Information
----------------
In order to display the website, this python module uses the Udacity *fresh_tomatoes.py* module found [here](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py). For more information on the changes/additions I made to the *fresh_tomatoes.py* module, please click [here](https://github.com/dimitb/Movie-Trailer-Site/commit/4b7f58b4b5c59993bfae64995c5a9fe974364dab).
